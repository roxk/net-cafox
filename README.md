A collection of simple utilities for Android.  
Basically a pet project to boost productivity during my previous work.  
Inside there are four module: debug, interpolation, navigation, and widget.

##### Debug

Two classes to print the lastest logcat output in a new activity when an app crashes.

##### Interpolation

Inside you will find an ios animation interpolator. Not a perfect simulation but better than nothing.

##### Navigation

Several navigation classes to manage navigation with animation in a single activity without fragment.

##### Widget

Some widgets which are commonly used, such as CircularBitmapView, MonthCalendarView, etc.
